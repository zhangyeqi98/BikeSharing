Area Zhuoyue Hao Shihang Wang Yeqi Zhang 2021-04-11 Chapter 1 Introduction Bike Sharing System, different from traditional rentals, can process membership, rental and return back automatic. Now, over 10 years has passed since the generation of Bike Sharing system. According to “Report on the current situation of global and Chinese bike sharing market in 2020 and its future development trend”, there are 400 million registered users globally for Bike Sharing System, and the system has become a non-neglectable component in modern cities daily life. The report also figured out that the application scenarios of bike sharing tend to transition from commuting necessity to leisure, especially in some European countries such as Italy. In 2013, Hadi Fanaee-T and Joao Gama utilize the open access data of Capital Bikeshare System, which is still one of the most long-lived Bike Sharing system in the world, to predict sensing mobility in Washington D.C and therefore detect the important events in this city. Given the current situations provided above, it would be quite interesting to track whether this research still valid under different background, such as the transition trend of usage habit and especially with the disturbance of the major events, Covid-19. To conduct a comprehensive study, we collect the weather data and Capital Bikeshare’s data in Washington D.C from 2019 to 2020, and propose 3 major questions, which write as: Service Activation Transition Rate: does the Registered customer base of the Capital BikeShare increases during our monitored period (Casual-user to Registered-user)? Deciding-Factor Analysis: how does the factors of weather type (temperature, humidity, windspeed) and date (year, month, hour, weekday) affect the count of the bike-sharing rental? Events/Holiday Detection: can we detect important events and holiday trends in the city by looking at the bike-rental data? "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources Two data sources were introduced in this research, the first one was from the homepage of Capital Bikeshare, which includes the following variables (731 samples, each sample indicate a day’s record in Washington D.C. during 2019 and 2020): Duration (Duration of trip), Start Date (Includes start date and time), End Date (Includes end date and time), Bike Number (Includes ID number of bike used for the trip), Member Type (Indicates whether user was a “registered” member or a “casual” rider), Season (Season type obtained from Start Date and End Date), Day Type (Weekday or Weekend Day obtained from Start Date and End Date). This data has been processed by Capital Bikeshare to remove trips that were taken by staff as they serviced and inspected the system, trips that were taken to/from any of our “test” stations at our warehouses and any trips lasting less than 60 seconds (potentially false starts or users trying to redock a bike to ensure it was secure). The other data source was from freemeteo.com, which provides detailed weather forecasts, real time weather observations, historical data for all regions of our planet. Here we collect weather records of Washington D.C in 2019 and 2020 to incorporate with the data collected from Capital Bikeshare. In accordance with our research objective, we include the following variables (731 samples, each sample indicate a day): date, min_temp (daily minimum temperature), max_temp (daily maximum temperature), max_steady_wind (maximum steady wind of the day), total_daily_precipitation (total daily precipitation), description (description of weather types, such as “rain”, “snowfall”, “thunderstorm”etc.). "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation The Capital Bikeshare data was collected by Zhuoyue Hao via … The weather data was collected by Yeqi Zhang via web crawler implementation, where the weather website was first downloaded by httr and GET function, and the table data was then extracted from the website by html_table function from rvest package. The detail of this process was displayed in Session3, Data Transformation. Note that the original weather data collected from freemeteo.com had 10 variables, the other variables were “maximum wind gust”, “snow depth”, “pressure”, “icon (of weather type)”. We abandon those variables for they are harder to be sensed by human beings (such as “pressure”) or less relevant to the questions we are studying, such as “maximum wind gust” and “snow depth”. The former one just indicated the weather condition of a particular moment, not the overall weather circumstance for the whole day, and the later one was just available in some particular days during the winter, while in most days of the year, there is no snow and of course, no “snow depth”. Besides, a few days of weather data from 2019 to 2020 were missing, for example, there was no data for 2020-12-30; therefore, the authors filled in the data of those missing days and marked their values as NAs.

(Note: given a fact that our Bike datasets have no missing values, the weather dataset would be our sole data.table to analyze NAs.) Data table: dat.dt.RData Varibles of our concern: ‘min_temp’, ‘max_temp’, ‘max_steady_wind’, ‘total_daily_precipitation’, ‘description’ 4.1 Heatmap for overall pattern Firstly, we would like to present an overall missing-value distribution of continuous days from 2019-01-01 to 2020-12-31 (total 731 days) and the plot shows: X : 6 most relevent variables Y: missing patterns (each day from 2019-01-01 to 2020-12-31) Vertically, variable ‘max_steady_wind’ has most missing values. Horizontally, missing values concentrate at the end of the year 2019 and year 2020 4.2 Visna() for overall pattern Visna() is another method to explore the potential patterns of missing-value distribution of continuous days (731 days) X : 6 most relevent variables Y: missing patterns (each day from 2019-01-01 to 2020-12-31) Vertically, variable ‘max_steady_wind’ has the most missing values as it ranks number-one at the bottom column-sort. Horizontally, for missing values patterns, pattern ‘max_steady_wind’ took place most frequently up to 71 times, which means there are 71 rows of data with ‘max_steady_wind’ value missing as NA. The next pattern is ‘min_temp, max_temp, max_steady_wind, total_daily_precipitation, description’ with frequency 5 times, which means 5 rows of data miss values for all variables. The complete pattern-rank goes from top to bottom as the right row-sort shows. ## max_steady_wind min_temp max_temp total_daily_precipitation description ## 1 0 0 0 0 0 ## 3 1 0 0 0 0 ## 5 1 1 1 1 1 ## 4 0 1 1 0 0 ## 2 0 0 0 1 0 ## attr(,&quot;mar&quot;) ## attr(,&quot;mar&quot;)$rm ## [,1] ## [1,] 652 ## [2,] 71 ## [3,] 5 ## [4,] 2 ## [5,] 1 ## ## attr(,&quot;mar&quot;)$cm ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] ## [1,] 0.1039672 0.009575923 0.009575923 0.008207934 0.006839945 ## ## attr(,&quot;orders&quot;) ## attr(,&quot;orders&quot;)[[1]] ## [1] 1 3 5 4 2 ## ## attr(,&quot;orders&quot;)[[2]] ## [1] 3 1 2 4 5 "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Deciding-Factor Analysis 5.2 Events/Holiday Detection", " Chapter 5 Results ##Service Activation Transition Rate 5.1 Deciding-Factor Analysis In 2019, most bike-sharing activities took place between March to October, in other words, between Spring to early Fall, among which Spring is the peak season users tend to engage in the bike-sharing, with daily average rental amount approching to 15,000. Under the impact of the pandemic, 2020 witnesssed a sharp decline of total rental amount and the trend tends to be more oscillating. Since May, the amount of registered users decreased while casual users increased. We want to explore how total rental amount of bike-sharing relates to each variable. Since variables are not the same type, we would split them into quantitative varibles and qualitative varibles and analyze seperately. 5.1.1 Quantitative-Varible Analysis min_temp (daily minimum temperature) max_temp (daily maximum temperature) max_steady_wind (maximum steady wind of the day) total_daily_precipitation (total daily precipitation) Heatmap on the left shows such three main clusters/groups of bike-sharing rental amount as High rental amount, Low rental amount and Medium rental amount (from bottom to top). Accordingly, the right four scatterplots present how these three rental groups relate to each quantitative variables. Note that the transparency of data points represents the magnitude of total rental amount: the more total rental amount each point holds, the darker it will be. Based on the plots, it is clearly observed that: More bike-sharing activities took place when temperature was above 20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees Fahrenheit) and less people cycled when it was cold, especially when temperature was subzero. People prefer to rent and ride bicycles on non-rainy days with precipitation below 10mm. Noticeable, some users did enjoy rainy-cycling with precipitation above 20mm and few users even choose the service when it rained over 70mm. Non-windy days with 15-30 km/h wind usually attracted more users to the bike-sharing service. Indeed, some users would choose the service when it blew at over 50 km/h. 5.1.2 Qualitative-Varible Analysis Weekday (weekday of the date) Season Description (weather type of the date) Based on the ridge-plots, we could observe that: Saturday and Sunday tend to attract more users to cycle, whose distributions center on higher total rental amount (over 10,000). Noticeably, Monday through Friday almost have the same distributions, which may imply users’ daily commuting necessity. Spring and Summer are users’ favorite seasons to engage in the bike-sharing activiteis while Fall attracted certain amount of users as well. Besides, there was a great variation in Spring’s total rental amount, which implies the distinctive year-on-year decline in 2020, i.e. the Covid-pandemic year. As expected, sunny days (Weather events not reported) are users’ top choices to ride bicycles while people cycled less on rainy and snowy days (Rain, Fograin, Snowfall, Snowfallrain). Surprisingly, thunderstrom days (ThunderstormRain and FogThunderstromRain) did not undermine people’s passion for bike-sharing and this phenomenon could be attributed to residents’ adaptation to frequent thunderstroms. Also, on thunderstorm days, for those who do not drive, cycling would become alternative commuting type to consider, given the shortage of ride-hailing vehicles due to increased demand. 5.2 Events/Holiday Detection "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion "]]
